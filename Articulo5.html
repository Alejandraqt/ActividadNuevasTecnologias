      <h3>Resumen:</h3>
        <p>Sports can combine virtual reality technology with high-precision training to enhance the training 
            effectiveness of users. In view of the current problems of insufficient physical quality and lack 
            of exercise motivation faced by college students, this paper aims to explore a new type of college 
            sports game teaching model through the integration of virtual reality technology. This is to improve 
            students 'physical exercise efficiency and subjective initiative. This study constructed an experiential 
            sports game model by applying posture recognition technology and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. 
            The research indicated that the error accuracy with residual structure added will quickly decrease. When 
            calculating the error, the overall error decreased by 6 mm. The proposed method can accurately distinguish 
            human behavior in motion and trajectories in the motion area. The motion capture accuracy was high, and 
            the deformation amount met the teaching needs of higher education institutions for sports game teaching.
